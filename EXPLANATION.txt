	  First,we chose our project manager and every member has given a task.We discussed what game to be created and we come up with our first idea, 
	  spaceship game with the same gameplay. But,we have difficulty in making the code and graphics, so we shifted in doing researches and watching tutorials about Unity. 
	  After a long discussion and Brainstorming, we come up with the idea of creating a car game and we called it CrazyCar, it's main objective is get higer time by avoid bumping the cars
	  facing the direction of the player.
	  CrazyCar composed of main camera, scenes, level, game objects with scripts, sprites and prefabs. Remember that a game object dont do anything witout script, and a script dont do anything without a game object.
	  Our game had a bug like not displaying the score on the game over menu, and not randomly spawn the enemies.
	  Its very hard making games. We thought that its simple. We learned important lessons of being a computer science student. First, we must manage time very well. We must do our best and beleive on yourself.
